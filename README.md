# Kyoto Tech Meetup Website

This repository holds the Astro-powered marketing site for the Kyoto Tech Meetup community.

Everything here is maintained by community members; contributions that make the experience clearer, more accessible, or easier to maintain are welcome.

## Tech Stack

- [Astro 5](https://astro.build/) with React islands for dynamic UI.
- [Tailwind CSS 4 (via `@tailwindcss/vite`)](https://tailwindcss.com/) for utility-first styling plus a small layer of global CSS.
- [Marked](https://marked.js.org/) for rendering Markdown copy inside Astro components.
- ESLint (flat config), TypeScript, Knip, and Astro Check keep the project tidy.

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the local dev server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   Visit `http://localhost:4321` to view the site. Astro enables hot module replacement, so edits appear immediately.

3. Build for production:

   ```bash
   npm run build
   npm run preview
   ```

| `npm run feeds:notify:dry-run` | Shows what the notifier would send without posting or updating state. |

## Contributing

1. Fork or clone the repo, then branch from `main`.
2. Make your changes and commit on your branch.
3. Before submitting a pull request:
    1. Ensure your local branch is up to date with `main`.
    2. Run `npm run check` to ensure lint, type, and Astro diagnostics all pass.
4. Push your branch to the remote repository.
5. Open a pull request, describing what you changed.
6. Request a review.

## Ideas for Contributions

- Expand homepage content (additional recurring events, partner highlights, FAQs).
- Build an email newsletter signup form.
- Improve accessibility (ARIA labeling, color contrast, keyboard navigation checks).
- Add tests or visual regression tooling for future redesigns.
- Internationalization or localization improvements for Japanese/English visitors.

## Deployment

- Production deploys target [Cloudflare Pages](https://kyototechmeetup.com/) via Cloudflare's GitHub integration on merge to `main`.
- Pull requests use GitHub Actions for CI checks and Cloudflare Pages for preview deployments.
- GitHub can also trigger Cloudflare rebuilds via the deploy hook (`CLOUDFLARE_DEPLOY_HOOK`) every 3 hours by cron or by manual dispatch (`.github/workflows/scheduled-build.yml`).
- Community feed notifications are handled separately by `.github/workflows/community-feed-notifier.yml`, which polls approved feeds every 15 minutes and tracks seen items in a gist-backed JSON state file.
- The legacy [GitHub Pages URL](https://kyoto-tech.github.io/) is maintained as a redirect only, published from `.github/redirect-site` by `.github/workflows/deploy-github-pages-redirect.yml`.
- To test a production build locally, use `npm run build && npm run preview`.

## Community Feed Notifier

- The notifier reads approved sources from `src/data/member-feeds.json`.
- State lives in the public gist `62b890d0f91f5832a831cc0503293bc1` as `community-feed-state.json`.
- On the first non-dry run, the notifier seeds the current backlog into the gist without posting. Use the workflow dispatch input `allow_initial_posts` if you intentionally want to announce the backlog.
- For a lightweight demo, use the workflow dispatch input `demo_mode`. It posts at most 3 items and seeds the rest of the current backlog so later scheduled runs do not replay the full backlog.
- Required secret: `GH_GIST_TOKEN` with the `gist` scope.
- Optional secret: `DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL` for direct Discord posting.
- Optional secret: `COMMUNITY_FEED_GENERIC_WEBHOOK_URL` for forwarding each new item as JSON to your own bot/service for X, LINE, or other destinations.
